## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE

**HEADING:**
SHADOW DETECTION AND REMOVAL IN DIGITAL IMAGES

**CONTENT:**
Advanced Computer Vision Techniques

Presented by: Shreya Kumari
Date: September 29, 2025
Course: Computer Vision Project

## SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT & OBJECTIVES

**HEADING:**
WHY SHADOW DETECTION MATTERS?

**CONTENT:**
THE CHALLENGE:
• Shadows create obstacles in computer vision systems
• Impact autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, security systems
• Traditional algorithms fail when shadows obscure features

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
• Develop robust shadow detection algorithms
• Compare HSV, LAB, and RGB color spaces
• Achieve 90%+ accuracy with sub-second processing
• Create interactive educational platform

GOAL: Detect and remove shadows while preserving texture

## SLIDE 3: METHODOLOGY & RESEARCH

**HEADING:**
RESEARCH FOUNDATION & APPROACH

**CONTENT:**
KEY RESEARCH PAPERS:
• Sanin et al. (2010) - Comprehensive shadow detection survey
• Le et al. (2018) - Deep learning approaches
• Salvador et al. (2004) - Color space analysis

PROCESSING PIPELINE:
1. Image Preprocessing (0.1s)
2. Color Space Conversion (0.2s)
3. Shadow Detection (0.3s)
4. Morphological Operations (0.1s)
5. Shadow Removal (0.2s)

TOTAL TIME: 0.8 seconds average

## SLIDE 4: COLOR SPACE COMPARISON

**HEADING:**
COLOR SPACE ANALYSIS

**CONTENT:**
PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
• RGB: 78% accuracy, 0.4s speed, Simple but limited
• HSV: 89% accuracy, 0.6s speed, Good balance
• LAB: 94.2% accuracy, 1.2s speed, Best accuracy

WHY LAB WORKS BEST:
• L* channel = Perceptual lightness (0-100)
• Separates luminance from chrominance
• Matches human visual perception
• Handles colored shadows effectively

ALGORITHM: Statistical analysis + Region growing

## SLIDE 5: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

**HEADING:**
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**CONTENT:**
HSV METHOD:
```python
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV)
v_channel = hsv[:,:,2]
threshold = np.mean(v_channel) - 0.3 * np.std(v_channel)
shadow_mask = v_channel < threshold
```

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
• Python 3.8+ with OpenCV 4.5+
• NumPy for vectorized operations
• HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for web interface

MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS:
• 5×5 kernel for noise removal and gap filling
• Opening + Closing for boundary refinement
